/**
 * You are given two string arrays username and website and an integer array timestamp. All the
 * given arrays are of the same length and the tuple [username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]]
 * indicates that the user username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].
 *
 * A pattern is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).
 *
 * - For example, ["home", "away", "love"], ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], and ["luffy", "luffy",
 * "luffy"] are all patterns.
 *
 * The score of a pattern is the number of users that visited all the websites in the pattern in the
 * same order they appeared in the pattern.
 *
 * - For example, if the pattern is ["home", "away", "love"], the score is the number of users x
 * such that x visited "home" then visited "away" and visited "love" after that.
 *
 * - Similarly, if the pattern is ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], the score is the number of users
 * x such that x visited "leetcode" then visited "love" and visited "leetcode" one more time after
 * that.
 *
 * - Also, if the pattern is ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"], the score is the number of users x such
 * that x visited "luffy" three different times at different timestamps.
 *
 * Return the pattern with the largest score. If there is more than one pattern with the same
 * largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern.
 *
 * Note that the websites in a pattern do not need to be visited contiguously, they only need to be
 * visited in the order they appeared in the pattern.
 *
 * ! 3 <= username.length <= 50
 * ! 1 <= username[i].length <= 10
 * ! timestamp.length == username.length
 * ! 1 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9
 * ! website.length == username.length
 * ! 1 <= website[i].length <= 10
 * ! username[i] and website[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
 * ! It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least three websites.
 * ! All the tuples [username[i], timestamp[i], website[i]] are unique.
