/**
 * You are given a string s and an integer t, representing the number of transformations to perform.
 * In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:
 *
 * - If the character is 'z', replace it with the string "ab".
 *
 * - Otherwise, replace it with the next character in the alphabet. For example, 'a' is replaced
 * with 'b', 'b' is replaced with 'c', and so on.
 *
 * Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.
 *
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * ! s consists only of lowercase English letters.
 * ! 1 <= t <= 10^5
