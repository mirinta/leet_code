/**
 * Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths,
 * where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.
 *
 * - For example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three".
 *
 * Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty
 * set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at
 * the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as
 * well as all their subfolders.
 *
 * - For example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as
 * their subfolders) should all be marked:
 *   - /a
 *   - /a/x
 *   - /a/x/y
 *   - /a/z
 *   - /b
 *   - /b/x
 *   - /b/x/y
 *   - /b/z
 *
 * - However, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders "/a" and "/b"
 * would not be identical. Note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still be considered identical even with
 * the added folder.
 *
 * Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete
 * all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical
 * after the initial deletion are not deleted.
 *
 * Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the
 * marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
 *
 * ! 1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4
 * ! 1 <= paths[i].length <= 500
 * ! 1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10
 * ! 1 <= sum(paths[i][j].length) <= 2 * 10^5
 * ! path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
 * ! No two paths lead to the same folder.
 * ! For any folder not at the root level, its parent folder will also be in the input.
