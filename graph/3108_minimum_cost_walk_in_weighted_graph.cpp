/**
 * There is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * You are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that
 * there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight of wi.
 *
 * A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex,
 * and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's
 * important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.
 *
 * The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the bitwise AND of the
 * weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights
 * encountered during the walk is w0, w1, w2, ..., wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 &
 * ... & wk, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.
 *
 * You are also given a 2D array query, where query[i] = [si, ti]. For each query, you need to find
 * the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex si and ending at vertex ti. If there exists no
 * such walk, the answer is -1.
 *
 * Return the array answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query i.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= edges.length <= 10^5
 * ! edges[i].length == 3
 * ! 0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
 * ! ui != vi
 * ! 0 <= wi <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= query.length <= 10^5
 * ! query[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= si, ti <= n - 1
