/**
 * You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed
 * integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of
 * each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j]
 * strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than
 * or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
 *
 * Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength.
 * You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at
 * most one magical pill.
 *
 * Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return
 * the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.
 *
 * ! n == tasks.length
 * ! m == workers.length
 * ! 1 <= n, m <= 5 * 10^4
 * ! 0 <= pills <= m
 * ! 0 <= tasks[i], workers[j], strength <= 10^9
