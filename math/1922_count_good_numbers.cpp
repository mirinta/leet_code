/**
 * A digit string is good if the digits (0-indexed) at even indices are even and the digits at odd
 * indices are prime (2, 3, 5, or 7).
 *
 * - For example, "2582" is good because the digits (2 and 8) at even positions are even and the
 * digits (5 and 2) at odd positions are prime. However, "3245" is not good because 3 is at an even
 * index but is not even.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the total number of good digit strings of length n. Since the answer
 * may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * A digit string is a string consisting of digits 0 through 9 that may contain leading zeros.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^15
