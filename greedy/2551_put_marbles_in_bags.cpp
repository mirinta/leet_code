/**
 * You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight
 * of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.
 *
 * Divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:
 *
 * - No bag is empty.
 *
 * - If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith
 * and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
 *
 * - If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of
 * the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].
 *
 * The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.
 *
 * Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
 *
 * ! 1 <= k <= weights.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= weights[i] <= 10^9
