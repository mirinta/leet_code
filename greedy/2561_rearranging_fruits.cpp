/**
 * You have two fruit baskets containing n fruits each. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays
 * basket1 and basket2 representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets
 * equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:
 *
 * Chose two indices i and j, and swap the ith fruit of basket1 with the jth fruit of basket2.
 * The cost of the swap is min(basket1[i],basket2[j]).
 * Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly
 * the same baskets.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or -1 if impossible.
 *
 * ! basket1.length == basket2.length
 * ! 1 <= basket1.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= basket1[i],basket2[i] <= 10^9
