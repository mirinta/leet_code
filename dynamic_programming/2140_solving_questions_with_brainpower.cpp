/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].
 *
 * The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order
 * (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question.
 * Solving question i will earn you pointsi points but you will be unable to solve each of the next
 * brainpoweri questions. If you skip question i, you get to make the decision on the next question.
 *
 * - For example, given questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]:
 *
 *   - If question 0 is solved, you will earn 3 points but you will be unable to solve questions 1
 *     and 2.
 *
 *   - If instead, question 0 is skipped and question 1 is solved, you will earn 4 points but you
 *     will be unable to solve questions 2 and 3.
 *
 * Return the maximum points you can earn for the exam.
 *
 * ! 1 <= questions.length <= 10^5
 * ! questions[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 10^5
