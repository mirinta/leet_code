/**
 * You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.
 *
 * In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j]
 * and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the
 * ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].
 *
 * Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately
 * after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that
 * each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹
 *
 * Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.
 *
 * ! n == skill.length
 * ! m == mana.length
 * ! 1 <= n, m <= 5000
 * ! 1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000
