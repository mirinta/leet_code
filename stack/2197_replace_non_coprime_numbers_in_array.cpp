/**
 * You are given an array of integers nums. Perform the following steps:
 *
 * 1. Find any two adjacent numbers in nums that are non-coprime.
 *
 * 2. If no such numbers are found, stop the process.
 *
 * 3. Otherwise, delete the two numbers and replace them with their LCM (Least Common Multiple)
 *
 * 4. Repeat this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.
 *
 * Return the final modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in
 * any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.
 *
 * The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to
 * 10^8.
 *
 * Two values x and y are non-coprime if GCD(x, y) > 1 where GCD(x, y) is the Greatest Common
 * Divisor of x and y.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 * ! The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to
 * ! 10^8.
