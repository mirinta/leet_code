/**
 * There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You
 * are given a 2D integer array classes, where classes[i] = [passi, totali]. You know beforehand
 * that in the ith class, there are totali total students, but only passi number of students will
 * pass the exam.
 *
 * You are also given an integer extraStudents. There are another extraStudents brilliant students
 * that are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each
 * of the extraStudents students to a class in a way that maximizes the average pass ratio across
 * all the classes.
 *
 * The pass ratio of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam
 * divided by the total number of students of the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass
 * ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.
 *
 * Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the extraStudents students.
 * Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 *
 * ! 1 <= classes.length <= 10^5
 * ! classes[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= passi <= totali <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= extraStudents <= 10^5
