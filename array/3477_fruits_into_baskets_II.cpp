/**
 * You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i]
 * represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the
 * jth basket.
 *
 * From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:
 *
 * - Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or
 * equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
 *
 * - Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
 *
 * - If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.
 *
 * Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.
 *
 * ! n == fruits.length == baskets.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
